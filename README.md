# Tkinter - Scotland Yard

This gui replictes the famous Scotland Yard.
"Scotland Yard is a board game in which a team of players controlling different detectives cooperate to track down a player controlling a criminal as they move around a board representing the streets of London." you may have seen its ad on the tv by funskool.

It's my first GUI. Currently i have learned python and i'm trying to see python capabilites or you can say application.
It's made with Tkinter module in python. The program uses a other similar module, customTkinter. Thanks to this guy Tom Schimansky GitHub i got this amazing thing. It just make the old looking tkinter so much modern.
