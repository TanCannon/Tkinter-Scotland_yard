HOW TO USE THE GUI?

About player pieces and navigation:

The hat logos on the map are the officer/detective pieces.
They are named as Detective 1 , Detective 2....Detective 5 and Mr.X.
The available stations of a player (either an officer or Mr.X) are highlighted by a blue circle 
Click one of them to travel to that location.
The list becomes available (to that specific clicked station)on the ticket counter on the top left of the screen.
There you can find the available route with the tickets you have for each route and press travel to, well travel to your clicked station.

The 'DETECTIVE' and 'Mr.X' buttons can be used to know the amount of tickets a detective or Mr.X has for each route. 
They need to be refresed to know the latest information of tickets.

The 'Moves' keeps record of the moves made by the players.

On top of the map there is button which shows the available station one can travel to.
This button can be pressed to autoscroll to the current player position in case you get lost in the map.
The map autoscrolls to the current player loctaion by default.
The map has drag and scroll feature.


The current player piece glows.

About player turns:

When its Mr.X turn, a dialogue box appears 'Mr.X ur turn'.
The one choose to be Mr.X is supposed to click press and play.
After his/her turn a dialog box appears showing what Mr.X has used, its need to be showed others and then the next player (detective) make there move.

In case a '2x' is used by Mr.X, he/she need to show the dialog box 'Mr.X has used a 2x' to the detectives and then only should proceed or else
its cheating.  

Okay that's it!Good luck detectives and Mr.X.
